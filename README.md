🎮 Building a "Simon Says" Game 🎨

I'm thrilled to share a recent project I completed: a "Simon Says" game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌟 This classic memory game challenges players to follow and repeat a sequence of colours, providing a fun and engaging way to test your memory skills. 🧠✨

➡ Project Highlights 🚀

1️⃣ Interactive User Interface: The game features a simple, intuitive interface with four coloured buttons—red, green, blue, and yellow. 🔴🟢🔵🟡 These buttons light up in a sequence that the player must remember and repeat.

2️⃣ Dynamic Gameplay: With each new round, the game adds another colour to the sequence, gradually increasing the difficulty. 🔺 The challenge lies in remembering and repeating the growing sequence accurately.

3️⃣ Feedback Mechanism: The game provides immediate feedback to the player. Visual cues (like lighting up the buttons) and sounds 🎵 help players know whether they are on the right track or have made a mistake.

➡ Learning Outcomes 📚

Working on this project was an incredible learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

1️⃣ JavaScript Event Handling: Implementing the game required extensive use of JavaScript to handle user interactions. 👨‍💻 This included detecting button clicks, managing game states, and controlling the sequence of colours.

2️⃣ CSS for Visual Feedback: CSS played a crucial role in providing visual feedback. By dynamically adding and removing classes, I could change the buttons' appearance to indicate they were pressed or part of the sequence. 🎨

3️⃣ Game Logic and Flow: Designing the game logic to handle sequences, user input, and game progression was a great exercise in problem-solving and control flow management. 🧩

➡ The Development Process 🛠️

1️⃣ Planning and Design: Before coding, I mapped out the game’s flow and user interactions. This step was essential to ensure a smooth user experience and clear game logic. 📝

2️⃣ Building the Interface: I created a clean and responsive interface. The design is simple yet functional, focusing on user interaction and visual clarity. 💻

3️⃣ Implementing Game Mechanics: JavaScript was used to bring the game to life. I wrote functions to generate sequences, handle user input, and check for correctness.
